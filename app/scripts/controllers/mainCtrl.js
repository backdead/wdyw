If it weren't for the Mac OS, some of the greatest pieces of music would not have been able to be produced or conceived with the professionalism and intricacy that certain Mac programs give us, in all genres all across the world. Steve Jobs has not only left a legacy of grandeur, but also an already gleaming piece of clay which can be shaped to be even stronger and more beautiful. The first stones he set, all those decades ago, have turned into mountains of splendour, and with his knowledge and trust carved deep in his many co-working visionaries, a true artist of the 21st century can rest in peace.

I could only imagine Mr. Jobs having the same spark of genius in his eyes when he was their age. I pray that Mr. Jobs was able to see the final good work of his hands with the iPhone 4S!

I've always admired your products, and never dreamed I would own any until I was a lot older and working in the real world (I am currently in my senior year of college). However, through hard work I have done now, I acquired a Macbook this past year, and was surprised with an Iphone by my parents for being on the Dean's list. Those who know me eventually got annoyed with me constantly saying, \" I can\'t believe I have a Mac, I can\'t believe I have an Iphone.\" Your life\'s achievements are incredible. You were blessed with a gift, and you shared it with the world. Not many can attest to that. As I mentioned, I do not know you aside from what I have read. I know you through the Macbook I am currently typing on, and the Iphone that is next to me. Regardless of how I know you, your passing strikes a chord with me. It is so hard to see someone with so much to give be taken so soon. Even as I type this I am at a loss of what to say. A part of me doesn\'t even know why I feel this need to say anything at all. I\'ll end with condolences to your family and friends. And a thank you, for being who you were, and doing everything you did while you were here. ",

Steve has been an inspiration to me, I wish I was able to meet him in person to express my appreciation for his passion that showed in the products he made. He did make the best products in the world. He really did care about the users as it showed in the products he made. We love you steve.",
