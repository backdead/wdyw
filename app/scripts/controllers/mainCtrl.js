If it weren't for the Mac OS, some of the greatest pieces of music would not have been able to be produced or conceived with the professionalism and intricacy that certain Mac programs give us, in all genres all across the world. Steve Jobs has not only left a legacy of grandeur, but also an already gleaming piece of clay which can be shaped to be even stronger and more beautiful. The first stones he set, all those decades ago, have turned into mountains of splendour, and with his knowledge and trust carved deep in his many co-working visionaries, a true artist of the 21st century can rest in peace.
